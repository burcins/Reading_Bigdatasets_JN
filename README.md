## Practice for reading big datasets

In this project, I worked on [California Road Network](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm) dataset as practice for reading and cleaning big datasets. I created csv files for further analysis, but in this part I only read the datasets and created csv files to make dataset ready for analysis.
